# World's Tallest Buildings

This project is a D3-based interactive bar chart that visualizes the ten tallest completed buildings in the world. It was developed as part of CS171: Data Visualization coursework.

## 📊 Features

- **Horizontal Bar Chart** showing the tallest buildings
- **Interactivity**: Click a building's bar or label to see more information
- **Multi-column layout** using Bootstrap grid system
- **D3.js Implementation**: Uses SVGs for dynamic drawing and updates
- **Clean & Accessible UI**: Labels, heights, and responsive design
- **Sorted View**: Buildings are displayed in descending order by height





## 📐 Design Decisions

- **SVG Drawing Area**: Minimum 500x500px for clarity
- **Label Placement**:
  - Building names on the left, right-aligned
  - Heights displayed inside bars at the right end
- **Fonts**: Uses Google Fonts (e.g., Roboto)
- **Color Scheme**: Muted backgrounds with primary highlights for clarity

## 🧠 Good Practices

- Modular functions for event listeners
- Proper documentation within JavaScript
- Semantic HTML and Bootstrap classes
- External CSS for styling — no `<br>` for spacing
